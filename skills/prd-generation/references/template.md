### 6.2 Evidence of Real Demand (Anti-Pseudo-Requirement Validation)

This section exists to ensure the product addresses a genuine need, not an imagined or unvalidated one. Provide concrete evidence from at least three of the following sources:

| Evidence Type | Detail | Source | Date |
|--------------|--------|--------|------|
| User Research / Interviews | [Summary of user interview findings, number of interviews conducted, key quotes] | [e.g., 15 user interviews in Q1] | [YYYY-MM-DD] |

| Support Tickets / Feedback | [Volume and pattern of related support requests or feature requests] | [e.g., 120 tickets in past 90 days] | [YYYY-MM-DD] |
| Usage Analytics | [Data showing user behavior that signals the need, e.g., drop-off rates, workaround usage] | [e.g., Mixpanel analytics dashboard] | [YYYY-MM-DD] |
| Market Validation | [Beta test results, landing page conversion rates, waitlist signups, letter of intent] | [e.g., 2000 waitlist signups] | [YYYY-MM-DD] |
| Revenue Impact Estimate | [Projected revenue impact or cost savings with assumptions stated] | [e.g., Finance team model] | [YYYY-MM-DD] |

### 6.3 What Happens If We Don't Build This?

[Describe the cost of inaction. What do users continue to suffer? What competitive ground is lost? What revenue opportunity is forfeited? Be specific with numbers where possible.]

## 7. Feasibility Analysis

### 7.1 Technical Feasibility

| Dimension | Assessment | Notes |
|-----------|-----------|-------|
| Technology Readiness | [Ready / Needs R&D / Unproven] | [Are the required technologies mature and available?] |
| Existing Infrastructure | [Sufficient / Needs Extension / New Build] | [Can current systems support this, or is new infrastructure required?] |
| Technical Risks | [Low / Medium / High] | [Key technical unknowns or challenges] |
| Prototype/POC Status | [Not Started / In Progress / Validated] | [Has a proof of concept been built and validated?] |

### 7.2 Business Feasibility

| Dimension | Assessment | Notes |
|-----------|-----------|-------|
| Revenue Model Clarity | [Clear / Needs Validation / Unclear] | [Is there a clear path to monetization or cost savings?] |
| ROI Estimate | [Positive / Break-even / Uncertain] | [Estimated return on investment with timeframe] |
| Strategic Alignment | [Core / Adjacent / Exploratory] | [How does this align with company strategy and OKRs?] |
| Stakeholder Buy-in | [Secured / In Progress / Not Started] | [Do key stakeholders support this initiative?] |

### 7.3 Resource Feasibility

| Dimension | Assessment | Notes |
|-----------|-----------|-------|
| Team Availability | [Available / Partially Available / Needs Hiring] | [Is the required team available within the timeline?] |
| Required Skills | [In-house / Needs Training / Needs External] | [Does the team have the necessary skills?] |
| Budget | [Approved / Pending / Not Requested] | [Is budget allocated for this initiative?] |
| Timeline Realism | [Achievable / Tight / At Risk] | [Can the proposed timeline be met with available resources?] |

### 7.4 Feasibility Verdict

[Provide a clear GO / CONDITIONAL GO / NO-GO recommendation based on the analysis above. If CONDITIONAL GO, list the conditions that must be met before proceeding. Be honest — a well-reasoned NO-GO saves more resources than a poorly justified GO.]

## 8. Problem Statement

- [Goal 2: State another measurable objective]
- [Goal 3: State another measurable objective]

### 9.2 Non-Goals

## 13. User Journey

[Describe the primary user journey through the feature. The Mermaid flowchart below should illustrate the happy path and key decision points.]

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[User lands on entry point] --> B{Is user authenticated?}
    B -- Yes --> C[Display main feature view]
    B -- No --> D[Redirect to login]
    D --> E[User authenticates]
    E --> C
    C --> F[User performs primary action]
    F --> G{Action successful?}
    G -- Yes --> H[Display success confirmation]
    G -- No --> I[Display error message]
    I --> F
    H --> J[User continues or exits]
```

[Replace the diagram above with the actual user journey for your feature. Include branching paths for error handling, edge cases, and alternative flows.]

## 14. Feature Architecture

[Provide a high-level view of how the feature's components interact. This is not a detailed system design; it is a conceptual map showing services, APIs, data stores, and external systems involved.]

        B[Mobile Application]
    end

    subgraph Backend Services
        C[API Gateway]

    end

    A --> C
    B --> C
    C --> D
    D --> F
    D --> G
    D --> E
    D --> H
```

[Replace the diagram above with the actual architecture for your feature. Label each component clearly and show the direction of data flow.]
